# solBasics - Solidity Playground 
A mini project that will help learn the fundamentals of Solidity and smart contract development. This goes over most common concepts, such as:

- Types
- Mappings and Structs
- Functions and Constructors
- Events and Modifiers
- Memory and Storage

At the end of this, I created a basic dApp where users can deposit and withdraw funds from.
